# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and neural network concepts from scratch using Python. The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work behind the scenes by building them without using libraries like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow` for the core functionalities.
